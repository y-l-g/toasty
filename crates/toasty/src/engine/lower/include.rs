//! Lowering for `Returning::Model` includes and deferred-field masking.
//!
//! `mapping::Model::default_returning` is computed at schema-build time with
//! every deferred field — top-level or nested inside an embedded type —
//! pre-masked to `Null`. Lowering starts from a clone of the default
//! expression and splices loaded forms in for fields named by `.include()`
//! paths or, for an `INSERT … RETURNING`, for every deferred field.
//!
//! The recursion is mapping-driven: each `mapping::Field` variant decides how
//! to descend into its corresponding expression. Driving off the mapping
//! tree (rather than the expression's shape) is what lets us reach a
//! deferred sub-field of an embed struct nested inside an enum variant —
//! the masked `Null` lives inside a `Match` expression, not a `Record`.
//!
//! Include entries arrive as [`stmt::Include`] values. The first thing we do
//! is flatten any `PathRoot::Variant` chain
//! into a plain projection of the form `[…parent_steps, variant_idx,
//! …local_var_field_steps]`. This LOCAL form mirrors the IR's `Match` arm
//! record (where each arm is `[disc, field_0, field_1, …]`), so descent
//! through enum variants is just two index steps: one selecting the arm by
//! variant index, the next addressing a local variant field.
//!
//! The flow:
//!
//! ```text
//! process_top_level_includes
//!     └─► process_fields ──┬──► relation field: build_include_subquery

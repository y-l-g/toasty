# Toasty Path System

A `Path` is a rooted reference to a field in the application schema. It names "the field at this location of this model" without committing to any particular database column or expression form. The query engine, the macro-generated query builder, and the schema layer all use paths to talk about fields.

This document describes how paths are represented, how the typed and untyped layers fit together, and where paths appear across the system.

## Overview

A path has two parts:

- A **root** — either a model (`PathRoot::Model(ModelId)`) or a specific enum variant (`PathRoot::Variant { parent, variant_id }`).
- A **projection** — a sequence of field indices that navigate through the rooted value.

```
Path {
    root: PathRoot::Model(user_model_id),
    projection: [2],          // third field on User
}
```

A path with an empty projection refers to the root itself. A path with a non-empty projection navigates one or more steps into the value.

The core type lives in `toasty-core/src/stmt/path.rs`. `Projection` (in `toasty-core/src/stmt/projection.rs`) is a small inline-optimized vector of field indices that supports identity (zero steps), single-step, and multi-step forms.

## Why Paths Exist

Toasty queries are written against the application schema (models and fields), but they execute against database tables. Paths give the engine a stable way to refer to a model field across this gap:

- The macro-generated query builder produces paths from typed field accessors — `User::fields().name()` returns a `Path<User, String>`.
- The simplification and lowering phases inspect paths to resolve relation traversals into subqueries and to translate model fields into table columns.
- The schema layer resolves a path to a `Field` definition via `Schema::resolve_field_path`.

Paths are also what `into_stmt()` converts into the engine's expression IR. A path is not itself an expression — it's a reference that becomes one when the engine needs to read a value.

## Typed and Untyped Layers

Paths exist in two layers, mirroring the boundary documented in [Type System](type-system.md):

### `toasty::stmt::Path<T, U>` — typed, user-facing

The wrapper in `crates/toasty/src/stmt/path.rs` carries two phantom type parameters: the root model `T` and the value type `U` at the end of the path. The typed layer:

- Prevents mixing models (`User::fields().email()` on a `Todo` query is a compile error).
- Selects the right comparison methods based on `U` (`is_none` only exists on `Path<T, Option<U>>`, `starts_with` only on string-typed paths).
- Produces `Expr<bool>` and `OrderByExpr` values from typed comparisons.

### `toasty_core::stmt::Path` — untyped, engine-facing

When a statement crosses into the engine via `db.exec()`, the generic parameters are erased and only the untyped path remains. This is the form the simplification, lowering, and planning phases see.

Conversion is one-way: typed paths convert to untyped via `From<Path<T, U>> for stmt::Path`, but the engine never reconstructs the typed form.

## Roots

`PathRoot` has two variants:

### `Model(ModelId)`

The default root. Subsequent projection steps index into the model's declared fields.

### `Variant { parent: Box<Path>, variant_id: VariantId }`

Used when a path navigates into a specific variant of an embedded enum. `parent` is the path that reaches the enum field itself; `variant_id` records which variant the path enters.

Variant-rooted paths support the closure-based `.matches()` API on enum variant handles. For example:

```rust
User::fields()
    .contact()           // Path<User, ContactInfo>
    .email()             // EmailVariantHandle<User>
    .matches(|e| e.address().eq("alice@example.com"))
```

`.matches()` does two things:

1. ANDs in a discriminant check (`is_var`) so the filter only matches rows whose `contact` field is the `Email` variant.
2. Hands the closure a fields struct whose path was converted via `Path::into_variant(variant_id)`, so accessors inside the closure produce variant-rooted paths.

When the engine lowers a variant-rooted path to an expression, projection indices are offset by 1: position 0 of the variant's record holds the discriminant, and variant fields start at position 1. The offset is applied in `Path::into_stmt`.

## Projection

A `Projection` is a sequence of `usize` field indices. Projections support three internal representations — identity (zero steps), single-step, and multi-step — chosen based on size to avoid allocation for the common cases.

The `path!` macro in `toasty-core/src/macros.rs` builds projections from a dot-separated index list:

```rust
let p: Path = path![.0 .1];   // two-step projection
```

Projection equality and hashing are designed so single-step projections compare and hash like a bare `usize`, which lets `IndexMap` lookups accept either form interchangeably.

### Shared-column steps

One exception to "steps are field indices": embedded-enum gateless
shared reads (`#[shared]`) reuse Model-rooted single-step projections
with steps at or above
`EmbeddedEnum::shared_step_base(fields.len(), variants.len())`,
past every reachable per-variant record position and every variant index:

```
creature().name()                // projection [creature_idx, 5], 5 = base(4) + 0
creature().human().profession()  // gated read: record position 2
```

`Schema::resolve` and lowering decode steps `>= base` via
`EmbeddedEnum::shared_read_at_step`
(`toasty-core/src/schema/app/model.rs`) before the generic per-variant
distribution runs, so the two encodings never meet.

## How Paths Are Used

Paths appear in every part of the system that needs to name a field.

### Filter expressions

Comparison methods on typed paths produce filter expressions:

```rust
User::filter(User::fields().name().eq("Alice"))
```

Each method (`eq`, `ne`, `gt`, `ge`, `lt`, `le`, `in_list`, `in_query`, `is_none`, `is_some`, `starts_with`, `like`, `ilike`) calls `Path::into_stmt()` to turn the path into an `Expr`, then wraps it with the appropriate operator.

### Ordering

`Path::asc()` and `Path::desc()` produce `OrderByExpr` values for `Query::order_by`.

### Eager loading via `include`

`Returning::Model` carries `include: Vec<Path>`. `Query::include` appends a path:

```rust
let mut q = User::all();
q.include(User::fields().todos());
```

During lowering (`engine/lower.rs:889`), `build_include_subquery` walks each include path, resolves it to a relation field, and replaces the field's `Null` placeholder in the returning expression with a subquery that loads the related records.

### Association traversal

`stmt::Association { source: Box<Query>, path: Path }` represents reaching a model by following a relation from another query's results. The simplification phase resolves `Association.path` to a relation field and rewrites the traversal into an explicit subquery. See [Query Engine Architecture](query-engine.md#phase-1-simplification) for how associations are simplified.

### Update and assignment targets

Update statements address fields by path. The same typed accessors used for filters identify the field being assigned.

### Variant filters

`.matches()` on a variant handle uses `Path::into_variant` to root subsequent path steps at the variant. This is the only way a path can navigate through an enum to reach a variant-specific field.

### Schema resolution

`Schema::resolve_field_path` (in `toasty-core/src/schema/app/schema.rs`) takes a path and returns the `Field` it refers to. The simplification phase uses this to turn relation paths into concrete relation metadata.

### Field-bitset metadata

`PathFieldSet` (in `toasty-core/src/stmt/path_field_set.rs`) is a bitset of field indices. It is used by `SparseRecord` to mark which fields are present in a partial record and by the schema mapping layer to track which fields back a column. It is named for the path system because its indices are projection-compatible — a single-step projection equals the corresponding bit — but it does not carry a root.

## Path-to-Expression Lowering

`Path::into_stmt()` is the bridge from path to expression IR. The conversion depends on the root:

**Model root:**

- Empty projection → `Expr::ref_ancestor_model(0)` (the root record itself).
- Non-empty projection → `Expr::ref_self_field(FieldId)` for the first step, followed by `Expr::project` for any remaining steps.

**Variant root:**

- Recursively lowers the parent path to an expression that reaches the enum field.
- Empty projection → returns the parent expression unchanged.
- Non-empty projection → projects the parent expression at `local_idx + 1` (skipping the discriminant), then applies any remaining steps as a further projection.

The result is consumed by the lowering phase, which then translates field references to column references using the `TableToModel` mapping. See [Query Engine Architecture](query-engine.md#phase-2-lowering) for how the resulting expressions become table-level statements.
